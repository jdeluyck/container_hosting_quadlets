This repo contains a demo template that I created while trying out various web-deployment methods.
It was used with [podman](https://podman.io/) on top of [openSUSE MicroOS](https://microos.opensuse.org/).

I'm just posting it here in case it's useful for someone.

To deploy, have a look at the `deploy-template-mariadb` script.
